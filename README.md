---Advent of Code 2024---

This is my first time trying the Advent of Code.
I am currently in my first year teaching AP CSP but I have some experience with coding in the past.
I am hoping to use this to continue to practice my skills with Python, and perhaps branch into Java.

I'll probably make notes in this as I go, but for right now I'm not entirely sure so... Enjoy?
